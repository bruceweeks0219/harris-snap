# Cost in Â£
# Speed in mph (cruising, approx)
# Ceiling in 100ft (only affects Navaid range)
# Capacity in lb (approx)
# Serviceability proportion
# Defence is 'just a number', high is bad.  In fact it controls the amount of damage done by a 'hit' from flak or a fighter
# Failure represents the chance of mech. fail. crashes and early returns, 'just a number', high is bad
# Accuracy controls navigational errors
# A range of 230 will reach Hamburg, 315 for Berlin.  Soesterberg could be under 120, while Schillig roads are about 175.  Munich (from Yorkshire) is up to 330
# Dates are entry and exit from service and exit from training units (null in each case means open-ended)
# Navaids lists which navigational aids this bomber can carry (a big set won't fit in a small bomber)
# Flags: NOARM,HEAVY,INC,OVLTANK,SLOWGROW,OTUB,LFS,SMBAY,...
# Bombloads: Ab=Abnormal, Pp=Plumduff-plus, Pd=Plumduff, Po=Plumduff (cookie only), Us=Usual, Ar=Arson, Il=Illuminator, Hh=Half-and-half (alternate Il and Po)
#	Pre-ABD, everyone uses Abnormal
# ConvertFrom is the name of a type it takes less time to convert squadrons over from, owing to relatedness

# True, or at any rate different, entry-dates:
# Stir 10 Feb 1941 (source: documentary film "Lancaster At War")
# Hal1 Nov 1940 (source: Merrick; 35 Sqn reformed 05/11, first a/c arrived 13/11, third 4/1); Mar 1941 (source: film "Forgotten Bombers of the RAF"); first op 10 Mar 41 Le Havre but shortly afterwards taken out of frontline for a month owing to unreliability (source: Halifax at War (BJ Rapier))
# Wind 23 October 1943 (first flight of prototype.  source: Wiki)
# Mosq 15 November 1941 (first B.IV, W4064, arrives at 105 Sqn.  source: Wiki)
# Selk "production seemed unlikely before January 1944" (source: The Stirling Bomber (MJF Bowyer))
# Hal3 Dec 1943 (source: Halifax (KA Merrick), adds "expansion of the [Mk III] force was relatively rapid and by mid-January 1944 nine squadrons were operational with the type" although some were using a mixture of IIs, Vs and IIIs)

# True obsolete-dates:
# Blen unknown; late 1940?
# Whit May 1942 (the 1000 raids; last ops four weeks earlier).  According to Wiki, 10 OTU used Whitleys until Sep 44!
# Hamp mid-Sep 1942 (source: wiki)
# (Wlng Oct 1943; but we keep them around indefinitely for OTUs)
# (Manc 26 Jun 1942)
# Stir mid-1943; or Dec 43 according to Wiki; or 8 Sep 1944 according to Bowyer (who also notes that 22/23 Nov 43 was "the last time that Stirlings participated in a long distance Main Force attack", 50 of them raiding Berlin, and that as of 1 Jan 44 "there were still 100 Stirlings on squadrons".)
# Hal1 unknown.  Jan44 IIs and Vs suspended from ops against Germany (Rapier)

# Note that most of these values change at various dates due to mods.
