# Cost in Â£
# Speed in mph (cruising, approx)
# Ceiling in 100ft (only affects Navaid range)
# Capacity in lb (approx)
# Serviceability proportion
# Defence is 'just a number', high is bad.  In fact it controls the amount of damage done by a 'hit' from flak or a fighter
# Failure represents the chance of mech. fail. crashes and early returns, 'just a number', high is bad
# Accuracy controls navigational errors
# A range of 230 will reach Hamburg, 315 for Berlin.  Soesterberg could be under 120, while Schillig roads are about 175.  Munich (from Yorkshire) is up to 330
# Dates are entry and exit from service (null in either case means open-ended)
# Navaids lists which navigational aids this bomber can carry (a big set won't fit in a small bomber)
# Flags: NOARM,HEAVY,INC,OVLTANK,SLOWGROW,OTUB,LFS,...
# Bombloads: Ab=Abnormal, Pp=Plumduff-plus, Pd=Plumduff, Po=Plumduff (cookie only), Us=Usual, Ar=Arson, Il=Illuminator, Hh=Half-and-half (alternate Il and Po)
#	Pre-ABD, everyone uses Abnormal
