==Schillig Roads==
The approaches to the Weser ports, passing the islands of Langeoog and Wangerooge, are a focal point for
 German merchant shipping.  They are named after the nearby village Schillig in Niedersachsen.

==Heligoland Bight==
As the Germans have yet to institute a convoy system, individual merchant ships can frequently be found in
 this bay, including much of the sea traffic from Hamburg and the Elbe, as well as the Weser ports.  It
 should be a profitable destination for so-called 'armed reconnaisance' flights.

==Wilhelmshaven Docks==
The port of Wilhelmshaven on the shore of the Jadebusen is a busy shipping terminal.  It also contains
 shipyards key to the Kriegsmarine fleet; the Admiral Graf Spee, for example, was built and launched here.
Consequently, both military and commercial vessels can often be found and attacked here.  However, the
 Germans are well aware of the inviting target it presents and have defended it with heavy flak.

==Hörnum, Sylt==
The naval air station at Hörnum, on the isle of Sylt in Schleswig-Holstein, is used as a base for the
 forces, mainly Dorniers, covering the Heligoland region.

==Norway Fleet==
This Kriegsmarine task force is steaming north for the invasion of Norway, and is beyond the range of
 land-based fighter cover.  However, several of the warships mount fairly heavy anti-aircraft guns.
It will remain within range of your bombers until the last week of April.

==Kiel Dockyards==
The base of the Baltic fleet of the Kriegsmarine, the shipyards of Kiel are home to many German warships.
Their importance has led the Germans to protect them with heavy flak.

==Brunsbüttel==
The docks of Brunsbüttel at the mouth of the Elbe often host German warships preparing for operations in
 the North Sea.  There is a considerable amount of flak here.

==Channel Dash==
The battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, the cruiser Prinz Eugen, and their escorts have left Brest, and
 are steaming at full speed up the English Channel.  We have been caught off guard and will only have time
 for one attack before they reach their bases.

==Le Havre==
The German naval base at Le Havre is their centre of operations in the English Channel; many E-boats and
 other small warships are based here.

==Lorient==
The U-boat pens at Lorient are home to the North Atlantic submarine fleet of the Kriegsmarine which is
 having such a severe effect on our merchant convoys from America.

==Kiel Canal==
As well as providing a shortcut connecting the Baltic Sea to the Jadebusen and thus the North Sea, the
 Kiel Canal is also the slipway for a number of U-boat factories.

==Mittelland Canal==
Germany's main east-west waterway, the Mittellandkanal, runs from the Dortmund-Ems Canal to the Elbe.
This arterial route is filled with barges carrying raw materials eastward from the Ruhr.

==Dortmund-Ems Canal==
The Dortmund-Ems Canal runs north from the Ruhr industrial area to the seaport at Emden in Niedersachsen.
Via links to other canals, it takes Ruhr steel to the shipyards of Wilhelmshaven and Bremen, among other
 strategic cargoes.
The War Office have identified a location where flak defences are fairly weak and traffic is often backed-
 up due to a congested flight of locks.

==Ostende Barges==
The Belgian port of Ostende is filled with sea-going barges preparing for the invasion of Britain.  There
 is very heavy flak here.

==Calais Barges==
As the closest point on the Continent to the British Isles, Calais is a natural embarkation point for the
 invasion, and the Germans are amassing many barges here, protected by extremely strong flak.

==Dunkerque Barges==
Having already sent one army across the English Channel, Dunkirk is now preparing for another, as barges
 prepare to launch the German invasion of Britain.  The flak is very strong.

==Boulogne Barges==
Heavy flak surrounds the barges at Boulogne, which stand ready for the invasion.

==Berlin==
The German capital is a sprawling modern city of over 4 million inhabitants.  It is a major rail hub, and
 lies on the Spree and Havel rivers.  Major industries include U-boats, electrical cables, and
 electronics; many German radar sets are manufactured here.
Berlin's flak defences are strong and well-trained, and the Luftwaffe always keeps a defensive force close
 to the capital.
While much of the flight to Berlin can be routed over the North Sea, there is still a long stretch over
 Schleswig-Holstein and Brandenburg.  In particular the bombers must be routed around Hamburg and Bremen,
 both well defended.  Alternatively, a more northerly route via the Baltic Sea and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern
 can avoid the strongest defences, at the cost of a longer flight and thus smaller bomb loads.

==Hamburg==
The city of Hamburg, on the Elbe, is a major port city.  It contains large oil works, and the Blohm und
 Voss shipyards and aircraft factory.  Hamburg is also a major financial and banking centre.
Hamburg's port is used mainly for merchant shipping, but it is also a launching point for many U-boats
 headed for the North Sea and Atlantic.
The wooden buildings of the old town centre should burn effectively if enough incendiary-heavy loads are
 used.  Hamburg's large size and accessible location (it is only 70 miles from the North Sea coast) have
 led the Wehrmacht to install fairly strong anti-aircraft defences.  It lies within the region covered by
 the 2nd Fighter Division.

==Frankfurt==
Frankfurt am Main, in Hesse, is a commercial city of around half a million inhabitants.  It is also the
 financial centre of the Rhine-Ruhr-Main region.  However, its most important war industries are the IG
 Farben chemical works, which supply a substantial fraction of the Wehrmacht's explosives, and the VKF
 ball-bearing works.  The city's industry is well-concentrated.  Navigation in the region is helped by
 clear ground features including the River Main.
Its location to the south-east of the Ruhr means that it is difficult to reach without crossing the
 defences of that industrial heartland.  Its own defences, by comparison, are mediocre.

==Munich==
Deep in Bavaria, Munich is one of the most distant targets in Germany.  As the original home of the Nazi
 party, it has considerable political significance.  Industrially, it contains major Siemens electrical
 works, BMW, and the truck manufacturer MAN.  It has a population of around 800,000.  Munich's rail yards
 are a transportation hub for much of Bavaria, as well as Germany's gateway to Central Europe.
The defences of Munich are very strong; while lacking in fighter cover, there are a great many Flak guns
 in and around the city.  This, combined with its location, makes it a difficult target to attack.

==Cologne==
Astride the river Rhine, the city of Cologne has three-quarters of a million inhabitants.  Its industries
 include oil refineries and automotive engineering.  The airport at Butzweilerhof is second in importance
 only to Berlin Tempelhof.
Cologne is also a major military headquarters, responsible for much of the Rheinland.
Flak defences in Cologne are only moderate; it relies mainly on fighters for protection.

==Essen==
The industrial city of Essen in the Ruhr valley is home to the Krupps armament works, as well as coal
 mining and iron and steel production.  Overall the city can be characterised as 'heavy industry'.  There
 is a permanent industrial haze or smog over the city, which may make target finding difficult.
Essen is protected by a large contingent of Flak guns from its own factories, both within the city and
 around it to cover various approaches.

==Dusseldorf==
Dusseldorf is an industrial city on the banks of the Rhine.  It contains extensive steelworks, as well as
 an oil refinery and minor automotive factories.  Mostly its production is in raw materials which feed the
 heavy industry of the Ruhr valley.
The defences of Dusseldorf are surprisingly weak, though the surrounding area does contain quite a lot of
 scattered Flak.

==Dortmund==
The largest city in the Ruhr area, Dortmund has a little over 500,000 inhabitants.  Besides collieries and
 coking plants, the city also contains a wide variety of metalworking concerns.
The flak defences are moderately strong, and there are further flak guns in nearby villages.

==Bochum==
The city of Bochum in Nordrhein-Westfalen is home to coal-based heavy industry including the Bochumer
 Verein steelworks.  Its flak defences are moderate, but it is close to several other well-defended areas.

==Duisburg==
The industrial city of Duisburg, at the confluence of the Rhine and Ruhr, is a major centre of iron and
 steel smelting.  It also contains important chemical works, and a major inland harbour.
Its flak defences are somewhat weak.

==Hagen==
With a little over 100,000 inhabitants, Hagen is a compact city, built where the Ruhr meets the Volme and
 Lenne.  Its marshalling yards and rail links make it a key transportation hub for the Ruhr region.
It has fairly weak flak, but is surrounded by a number of 'hot spots'.  Its small size may also make it
 difficult to find and hit.

==Bonn==
The city of Bonn has limited industrial significance, but its location on the Rhine will make it
 militarily important for any attempt to invade Germany with land forces.
Bonn's flak is moderate.

==Wuppertal==
Though Wuppertal was once the dominant industrial region of northwest Germany, its unfavourable location
 on the steep hillsides of the Wupper Valley has stunted its growth somewhat.  The city's transportation
 network includes the unique Schwebebahn, an electric monorail system.
Industrially, Wuppertal contains both the typical Ruhr-region metallurgy, and more varied works such as
 automotive, chemical and textile factories.
Wuppertal is defended by moderate Flak.

==Hamm==

==Bremen==

==Kiel==

==Nuremberg==

==Leipzig==
The trading city of Leipzig, with around 700,000 inhabitants, contains major aircraft factories, and is
 thus a high priority target.  Its flak defences are strong.

==Stuttgart==
Besides the major U-boat works, the city of Stuttgart is also the home of the German automobile industry.
Overall it is an important centre of German war production, and correspondingly has fairly strong flak.

==Hanover==

==Dresden==
Though known for its chinaware output, Dresden is an industrial city of considerable size, containing a
 major rail terminal and a great number of light engineering works engaged in war production of all kinds.
The historic Altstadt contains many closely-packed wooden buildings, in which fires should spread easily.

==Augsburg==
The third-largest city in Bavaria (after Munich and Nuremberg), the city of Augsburg contains such
 important industrial facilities as the Messerschmitt aircraft works.

==Magdeburg==

==Schweinfurt==
The Air Ministry considers Schweinfurt a priority target due to the extensive ball-bearing works of the
 V.K.F. company.  It's a fairly compact and modern city, so will be difficult to destroy.

==Kassel==

==Bielefeld==
This city, best known for its fabric industry, represents a gap in our intelligence - our reconnaissance
 planes never seem to be able to find it.

==Mainz==

==Mannheim==

==Saarbrücken==
The industrial centre of the Saar coal basin, Saarbrücken is one of Germany's biggest steel producers
 outside of the Rhine-Ruhr region.

==Lübeck==
The medieval port city of Lübeck, on the Baltic coast, is expected to burn well.

==Rostock==

==Peenemünde==
The German Army and Luftwaffe are developing secret weapons at Peenemünde on the Baltic coast.  The FZG76
 is a pilotless 'flying bomb', and the Aggregat 4 is a long range rocket.  These weapons, if successfully
 deployed against London, could cause a great deal of damage, perhaps worse than the Blitz.

==Berlin Leaflets==
The four million inhabitants of the German capital are believed to be fairly susceptible to propaganda,
 and are thus a suitable target for leaflet flights.  There is a reasonable amount of flak in the city.

==Hamburg Leaflets==

==Frankfurt Leaflets==

==Cologne Leaflets==

==Essen Leaflets==

==Bremen Leaflets==

==Nuremberg Leaflets==

==Stuttgart Leaflets==

==Aalborg Airfield==
The aerodrome at Aalborg in northern Denmark is full of Junkers Ju52 transports, ferrying men and materiel
 into Norway in support of the German invasion of that country.  It's defended by fairly strong flak.

==Waalhaven Airfield==
The Luftwaffe Kampfgeschwader based at Waalhaven are rolling back the Allied forces on the Continent.
Defences are moderate.

==Maastrichtweg Bridge==
The German army is crossing the Meuse at Maastricht.  Bringing down this bridge will slow their advance
 into Belgium.  However, the Germans have brought in heavy flak to defend it.

==Tongres Bridge==
Another bridge being used by the advancing German troops.

==Gembloux==
This road junction currently hosts a concentration of enemy troops.

==Breda road junction==

==Bapaume-Arras road==
An armoured column here is assaulting BEF positions.

==Sedan bridge==
The Germans are assaulting Sedan, on the west bank of the Meuse; bringing down the bridge here will cut
 them off from reinforcements.  There's a fair amount of flak, and it's a difficult bridge to destroy.

==Le Cateau road junction==

==Soesterberg Airfield==
The air base at Soesterberg is being used by the Luftwaffe to launch air raids on Britain.
It's protected by fairly strong flak.

==Wesel road bridge==

==Calais Area==
A troop concentration threatening the British garrison in Calais.

==Near Dunkirk==
German troops in this area are attempting to prevent the BEF evacuation from Dunkirk.

==Berlin U-boat Works==
The submarine works in Berlin are responsible for a large part of the German production of ocean-going
 U-boats.  They have moderately strong flak defences.

==Tempelhof Airport==
Berlin Tempelhof is the hub for all civil aviation in the eastern reaches of Germany.  It is also the
 location of a training centre for Luftwaffe pilots.
Its flak defences are strong.

==Berlin Rail Junction==
The rail junctions, terminals, and marshalling yards of Berlin are responsible for a great deal of
 traffic, and vital to much of the region's industrial output.
They have moderate flak defences.

==Siemens, Berlin==
The Siemens factory complex manufactures a wide range of key goods, from electrical cables and radar sets
 to electric locomotives and even light bulbs.
It has moderate flak defences.

==München-Gladbach==
The marshalling yards at Münchengladbach handle most of the rail traffic carrying munitions west from the
 Ruhr into France and the Low Countries.
The flak defences are moderate.

==Cologne Oil Refinery==
The oil refinery at Cologne produces chiefly heavy fuels, such as diesel, for industrial uses.  These, by
 substituting for higher octane fuels, free up the latter for use in aviation.  Cologne's output also
 includes lubricating oils and various aromatic feedstocks.
Its flak defences are weak.

==Cologne Rail Yards==

==Cologne Power Station==
The coal-burning power station at Cologne supplies much of the electricity demand of the Ruhr industrial
 region.  It has fairly weak flak defences.

==Dusseldorf Steel Mill==
The steelworks at Dusseldorf supply this key raw material to many of the major factories in the Ruhr,
 notably the arms factories at Essen.  By their nature, the works are self-illuminating at night, making
 them an easy target to find and hit.  Their flak defences are surprisingly weak.

==Krupps, Essen==
The Krupps armament complex supplies Germany with guns of all sizes, including the 88mm anti-aircraft
 cannon and the machine guns of Luftwaffe fighters.
Krupps itself is fairly heavily defended, and there are numerous flak emplacements nearby.

==Zollverein Coalmine==
The coal supplies from this mine in Essen are vital to the metal smelting and other heavy industry of the
 surrounding Rhine-Ruhr region.
The mine itself has fairly weak defences, but the heavy flak guns of Krupps are close enough to give it
 some considerable protection.

==Hamburg Oil Refinery==
Hamburg's oil refineries provide high octane, low olefinic fuels, suitable for use in aero engines.  Their
 output also includes ethylene derivatives useful to the chemical industry.
The flak defences are fairly weak.

==Blohm + Voss==

==VKF Frankfurt==
Vereinigte Kugellager Fabrik are the Third Reich's main producer of ball bearings.  These are essential to
 the aircraft industry.
Their Frankfurt works have moderate flak defences.

==IG Farben, Frankfurt==
The IG Farben chemical works in Frankfurt supply a substantial fraction of the Wehrmacht's explosives, for
 bombs, mines, and shells.  They also produce a wide variety of chemicals from fertiliser to fuel
 additives.  Defences moderate.

==Bremen Oil Refinery==
The oil refinery at Bremen produces a large quantity of fuel, generally in fairly wide cuts and with
 rather high olefinic and aromatic content.  While unsuitable for specialised uses, these fuels are ideal
 for military transports and other heavy goods vehicles.  They are also used in locomotives.
Defences are weak.

==Focke-Wulf, Bremen==

==Antwerp Oil Depot==
The oil depot at Antwerp, encompassing refineries, storage and distribution, provides fuel to the
 occupation forces in France and Belgium.
Its flak defences are very weak, due chiefly to sabotage by Resistance activity.

==BFW, Augsburg==
The Messerschmitt factories of the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke produce many of the Third Reich's front-line
 fighter aircraft.  Their importance has led the Germans to defend it with fairly strong flak.

==MAN, Augsburg==
The Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nürnberg works in Augsburg produce diesel engines for U-boats.

==Gelsenkirchen Oil==
The Gelsenkirchen oil refinery produces mainly low olefinic paraffins and benzene derivatives.  The former
 are believed to be used in gas turbines, while the latter are used both in automotive fuels and as
 precursors for several chemicals important in explosives manufacture.

==Hüls Chemical Works==
The primary product of the chemical factory at Hüls is synthetic rubber, used for tyres.
Hüls' flak defences are moderate.

==Zollern Colliery==
This colliery in Dortmund helps to power the heavy industry of the eastern Rhine-Ruhr region.
Its flak defences are weak.

==Bochumer Verein==
The steel plant at Bochum has fairly weak flak defences.

==Bremerhaven Shipyards==

==Dorniers, Wismar==

==Junkers, Dessau==

==Stuttgart U-boat Works==

==VKF Schweinfurt==
The Schweinfurt ball-bearing factories of Vereinigte Kugellager Fabrik have fairly strong flak defences.

==Henschel Tank Works==

==MAN, Nuremberg==
This factory, operated by Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nürnberg, produces tanks and other armoured fighting
 vehicles for the German army.

==Munich Railyards==

==Siemens, Munich==

==Hamm Railyards==

==Duisburg Ironworks==

==Paderborn Tank Works==
An important tank factory.

==Hanover Bauwerke==

==Wilhelmshaven Shipyards==

==Heligoland Minelaying==
While the Heligoland Bight lacks well-defined shipping channels, the considerable sea traffic from the
 Weser ports and the Elbe make it a worthwhile 'Gardening' site.

==Biscay Minelaying==
The Kriegsmarine launches U-boats from several Biscay ports.  As these are French towns, bombing them
 isn't an option, so they must be blocked off with mines instead.

==Fehmarn Minelaying==
The narrow straits of the Fehmarn Belt are a busy route from the Baltic Sea to the North Sea.  They also
 carry traffic from Kiel.

==Øresund Minelaying==
The most direct route from the Kattegat to the Baltic is the Øresund which passes Copenhagen.

==Kattegat Minelaying==
All shipping between the Baltic and North Seas passes through the Kattegat and Skagerrak, where reefs and
 shallows confine traffic to a few narrow passages.

==Baltic Minelaying==
These shipping lanes feed into the Danish straits as well as the ports of Kiel, Lübeck and Rostock.
