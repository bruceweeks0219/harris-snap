==Installing Harris==

1. Obtain the source.
	There are two choices, (a) download a zipball, or (b) pull from git.
		a) Zipball.  Do this if you just want to play the game.
			Go to https://github.com/ec429/harris and click 'ZIP'; save the .zip file somewhere.  Extract it.
			Go to https://github.com/ec429/libatg and repeat.
		b) Git pull.  Do this if you want to do development on the game and maybe contribute some code back.
			[If you don't have it already, install the 'git' version control system <http://git-scm.com>]
			$ git clone git://github.com/ec429/libatg.git libatg
			$ cd libatg; git pull; cd ..
			$ git clone git://github.com/ec429/harris.git harris
			$ cd harris; git pull; cd ..

2. Install dependencies.
	You will need SDL from <http://www.libsdl.org>, as well as SDL_ttf, SDL_gfx and SDL_image.  You will also need the 'Liberation Mono' font.
	For the stats graphs, you will also need matplotlib, from <http://matplotlib.org>.
	On Debian, use the following:
	# apt-get install libsdl1.2debian libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2 libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-0 libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-4 libsdl-gfx1.2-dev fonts-liberation python-matplotlib
	For other systems, consult the above websites and/or your package manager's documentation.

3. Build libatg.
	$ cd libatg
	$ make
	$ sudo make install
	$ cd ..

4. Build Harris.
	$ cd harris
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

5. Run the game!
	$ harris
	At this point a small grey window with a menu should pop up.  For further help, see the Tutorial in the file 'howtoplay'.
