Groups, Stations & Squadrons

If a Group is operating a mixture of aircraft types, its serviceability is reduced: multiply the FA0 probability by the square root of the largest fraction (e.g. if a Group has 64 Lancs and 36 Stirlings, pFA0 for both is scaled by 80%).  Note that Halifax I and III are considered different types (mainly on account of the engines).

Stations mostly start out as grass strips and are only later paved.  Heavy bombers need concrete airfields to carry their full load â€” otherwise capwt and range are both reduced (to 75% and 80% respectively).  If a Station is operating a mixture of aircraft types, its serviceability is reduced: multiply the FA0 probability by the square root of the largest fraction (e.g. if a Station has 20 Lancs and 16 Stirlings, pFA0 for both is scaled by 74.5%, on top of the Group penalty).

Squadrons can have either two or three flights (of nominally 10 aircraft each).  A new two-flight squadron can be formed by splitting off the C flight of an existing three-flight squadron and posting in sprogs to fill it up; a two-flight squadron can be grown to three flights.  A squadron may be disbanded, causing its crews to be pooled for the Group's replacements (instead of sprogs).  A squadron may be remustered (moved) to another airfield within the Group area, which will take it out of the front line for 7 days.  A squadron may not operate a mixture of aircraft types; it must switch all at once to the new type, which will take it out of the front line for 14 days.
